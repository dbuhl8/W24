Just wanted to follow up with this issue. It seems using imshow in Python produces image artifacts, whereas using MATLAB results in the expected image. 
I've discussed this with another classmate who encountered this image artifact issue in Python, and they have also resolved it with MATLAB.

This could have just been an issue with how we invoked Python's imshow. That being said, I'll be just doing my data analysis with MATLAB this time around.

Hopefully this can be of use to you all!
