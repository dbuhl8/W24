\item %start of problem 1
The Schur decomposition theorem states that if $A \in C^{m\times m}$, then there
exist a unitary matrix $Q$ and an upper triangular matrix $U$ such that
$A = QUQ^{-1}$ . Use the Schur decomposition theorem to show that a real
symmetric matrix $A$ is diagonalizable by an orthogonal matrix, i.e., $\exists$ an
orthogonal matrix $Q$ such that $Q^T AQ = D$, where $D$ is a diagonal matrix
with its eigenvalues in the diagonal.

\begin{proof}

We begin with the Schur Decomposition Theorm for real symmetric matrix $A$. We have, 
\[
    A = QUQ^{-1} = QUQ^*
\]
By the property that $A$ is real and symmetric, we have that $A^* = A$.
\[
    A^* = A = QUQ^*
\]
\[
    Q^*A^*Q = U^* = Q^*AQ = U
\]
So we have, $U = U^*$. Since we have that $U$ is upper triangular, that means that $U^*$ is lower triangular. However, since they are equal to one another, we must have that they are both diagonal. Thereby we have that $A$ is diagonalizable by an othorgonal matrix $Q$ (a property of unitary matrices).
\[
    A = QUQ^* \implies Q^{-1}AQ = U = D
\]
Since we have this property, we have that $Q$ contains the eigenvectors of $A$ and $U$ is a diagonal matrix contianing its eigenvalues. 

\end{proof}
