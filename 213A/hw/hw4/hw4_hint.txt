Note that you're doing a linear regression problem, which fits the data in the "atkinson.dat" file.

You may first plot the data using Python/Matlab and see how it looks.

For instance, in Python you do:

>> import numpy as np
>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>> dd = np.loadtxt('atkinson.dat')
>> plt.plot(dd[:,0], dd[:,1],'o-')

or in Matlab, you do:

>> dd = load('atkinson.dat', '-ascii');
>> plot(dd(:,1),dd(:,2),'o-')

To do the data fit, recall a linear fit (or a curve fit) that we learned at the very beginning of Chapter 3.

In the PDF lecture note, this is "1.3.2 Polynomial fitting" where you now construct a Vandermonde matrix. Since the problem asks you to do a fit with a 3rd-degree polynomial and a 5th-degree polynomial, you will form two such matrices, one for each. You'll form 21x4 for a 3rd degree poly, for example since there are 21 data points.
