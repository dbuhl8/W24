Solve Momentum Equations, Temperature Equations, Div u = 0

NS:
du/dt + u *grad u = -grad P + BTkhat + (1/Re)laplacian u
Temp:
dT/dt  + u * grad T + u_z = (1/Re)Laplacian T
Continuity:
Div * u = 0

Code: 
NS: 
BT = Bthem*T - Bcomp*S
Dvisc = 1/Re
Dtherm = 1/Pe
Stherm = 1
Div * u = 0 is always satisfied. 


NonDim Nums: Re = 1000, Pe = 100, B = 100
IC: T(x, y, x) = 10cos(2pix/Lx + 2pix/Lz), U(x, y, z) = 0
Lz = 2pi, Lx = 4pi, Ly = 2pi
Nz = 32, Nx = 64, Ny = 32
Tmax = 10
